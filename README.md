# Kwin blur effect - Respect rounded corners


This kwin effect is a fork of the default kwin blur effect, with minimal changes
to solve the ["plasma kornerbug"](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395725).
It works with all decorations, including aurorae one's, and take care of maximized windows, that are assumed to not have rounded corners.

## Usage

After installing the effect, go to Settings --> Workspace behavior --> Desktop Effects.

- Disable the default blur effect ("Blur")
- Enable "Blur - Respect rounded corners"
- Tweak the settings of the effect to match your window decorations.

## Limitations

The effect only acts for window decorations. If the window has a decoration that have to be blurred and is not maximized, the rounded corners area are removed from the region "to be blurred". (before the blur occurs)

It seems to be not compatible with [ligthlyShaders](https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders) or [shapecorners](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shapecorners/).


## Plasma version

I only tested the effect on plasma 5.23.3, I don't know if it work with older versions (But it should, the changes from the default blur effect are very minimal)
